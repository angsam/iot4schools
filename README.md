# iot4schools.py

MicroPython helper library for connecting Raspberry Pi Pico W to Wi-Fi and Adafruit IO using MQTT.  
Developed as part of the **IoT4Schools** project to simplify cloud communication in MicroPython-based IoT applications for educational use.

## ‚ú® Features

- Connects Raspberry Pi Pico W to a Wi-Fi network with timeout and auto-reconnect
- Creates an MQTT client for Adafruit IO
- Simple, modular design ideal for students and educators
- Helps build IoT projects quickly and reliably

## üì¶ Installation

Copy the `iot4schools.py` file to your Raspberry Pi Pico W using [Thonny](https://thonny.org/). More details can be found in Teachers‚Äô guidelines for the project "Smart waste bins: how to improve waste management in smart cities?" published at https://www.iot.fizyka.pw.edu.pl (Results tab, Project #2).

## üöÄ Example Usage

```python
from iot4schools import connect_wifi, create_mqtt_client, connect_mqtt

# Connect to Wi-Fi
wlan = connect_wifi("YourSSID", "YourPassword")

# Create MQTT client for Adafruit IO
client = create_mqtt_client("your_username", "your_aio_key")

# Connect the MQTT client
connect_mqtt(client)

# Now you can use client.publish(), client.subscribe(), etc.
```

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- Raspberry Pi Pico W
- MicroPython firmware (v1.19 or newer)
- umqtt.simple module (included in standard MicroPython builds)

## üìö Project Context

This library was developed as part of the IoT4Schools project ‚Äî an international educational initiative bringing Internet of Things and cloud computing to schools across Europe using Raspberry Pi Pico W and MicroPython.
